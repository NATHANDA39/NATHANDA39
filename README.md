# Hey, I'm Nathan! 

## I work as an Information Technology Specialist in Accra, Ghana, where I analyze, test, troubleshoot, and evaluate existing network systems.

I am currently studying data analytics, driven by my passion for identifying inefficiencies in processes. I aim to optimize critical thinking, creativity, and problem-solving skills to tackle complex challenges in the workplace. Contributing to real-world solutions gives me a sense of accomplishment and purpose.
